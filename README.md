### In this notebook, we seek to understand the behavior of two solar power plants through the data generated by the photovoltaic modules and answer the following question: Can we identify faulty or sub optimally performing inverter with the data provided?

To do so, we dive into the following topics:
1.    Reminder on photovoltaic systems or PV systems
2.    EDA on:
 *    DC and AC power
 *    Irradiation
 *    ambient and module temperature
 *    yield
3.    Answer our question with the data gathered.

## Installation

No installation required, just open with any IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks, or click the link above the notebook to open with Google Colabs ( Preferred)


## Usage
If you want to run the file, on the third block of code, please comment out.

```plant1_generation = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/general/Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv')
plant1_weather = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/general/Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv')
plant2_generation = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/general/Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv')
plant2_weather = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/general/Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv")
```

and uncomment out.

```plant1_generation = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/Data_science/master/Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv')
plant1_weather = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/Data_science/master/Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv')
plant2_generation = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/Data_science/master/Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv')
plant2_weather = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drwatson93/Data_science/master/Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv')
```
